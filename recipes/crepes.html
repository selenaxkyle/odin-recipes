    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A few months ago, I shared a tutorial on making crepes and delved into the recipe's origins. When I was younger,
        we hosted the sweetest foreign exchange student who lived with us. Her father owned a bakery in France, and she
        passed on his crepe-making “secrets” to us.</p>

    <p>After learning how to perfect crepes (and fill them in countless different ways!), my mom made them frequently
        growing up. And now in my own home, I make them often for my family. My boys' favorite way to enjoy crepes is
        slathered with Nutella and filled with fresh sliced strawberries.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Whole milk:</strong> Makes the crepes creamy. Don't use low-fat milk.</li>
        <li><strong>White all-purpose flour:</strong> Gives the crepe its shape. Spoon and level it when measuring.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Gives it it's sweet flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Adds flavor. Use less if it's table salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsalted butter:</strong> Gives flavor and stops sticking. Melt and cool it before using.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla extract:</strong> Adds a sweet taste and smell.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Holds the crepe together.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutella:</strong> A creamy filling that makes these crepes. Warm it up a bit to spread easily.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix:</strong> Combine milk, flour, sugar, salt, melted butter, vanilla, and eggs in a blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Let the batter rest in the fridge</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet. Lightly butter it. Pour in some batter, swirl to spread thinly. Cook until golden, flip, cook the other side.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill & Serve:</strong> Spread Nutella on crepe, add fruits if desired, fold, and enjoy!</li>


    </ol>
