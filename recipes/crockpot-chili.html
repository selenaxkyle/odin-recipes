    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>First things first: this chili isn't your typical “dump it and forget about it” crockpot recipe, unlike most of the slow cooker recipes on my blog.</p>

    <p>Instead it's made <strong><em>better</em> by being slow cooked.</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smoky Flavors:</strong> Bacon adds a unique, smoky flavor that's not common in chili but makes a big difference!</li>
        <li><strong>Veggies:</strong> Sweet bell peppers, crunchy celery, and onions bring in sweetness and texture. Like it spicy? Jalapeños are for adjusting the heat.</li>
        <li><strong>The Base:</strong> Chili beans and diced tomatoes create a hearty foundation, while tomato paste makes it rich and thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Tender ground beef and flavorful Italian sausage pack the chili with texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor Boosters:</strong> A mix of spices add flavor and warmth, with a hint of sugar to balance things out. Worcestershire adds some tanginess, garlic for extra flavor, and beef bouillon to make it all taste even meatier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Fry Bacon:</strong> Cook until crisp, remove, and keep the grease (hello flavor!)</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Veggies:</strong> Sauté bell peppers, celery, onion, and jalapeño in bacon grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Meat:</strong> Cook ground beef and sausage, drain, and add to crockpot.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine in Crockpot:</strong> Add veggies, beans, tomatoes, and tomato paste to the crockpot.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Bacon:</strong> Crumble cooked bacon into the mix.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Cook:</strong> Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.</li>


    </ol>
